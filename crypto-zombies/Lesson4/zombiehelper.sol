/** 
Payable Modifier :- are a special type of function that can receive Ether.
--> msg.value is a way to see how much Ether was sent to the contract, and ether is a built-in unit.
--> If a function is not marked payable and you try to send Ether to it as above, the function will reject your transaction.
--> After you send Ether to a contract, it gets stored in the contract's Ethereum account, and it will be trapped there â€” 
    unless you add a function to withdraw the Ether from the contract.
--> Here `owner()` and `onlyOwner` are from OpenZeppelin's `Ownable.sol` smart-contract.
--> most important for _owner variable that it's have to be a address payable type for doing a sending and transferring
    ether instruction.
--> You can transfer Ether to an address using the transfer function, and address(this).balance will return the total 
    balance stored on the contract. So if 100 users had paid 1 Ether to our contract, address(this).balance would 
    equal 100 Ether.
--> You can use transfer to send funds to any Ethereum address. For example, you could have a function that transfers 
    Ether back to the msg.sender if they overpaid for an item
